## Installation

### Requirements

Selfie works with the following JVM test runners:

- JUnit5
- JUnit4 through junit-vintage
- PRs welcome for other test runners

Disk snapshots can be used with any JVM language, but inline literal snapshots only work if the test code is written in:

- java (8+ is okay, but 15+ is recommended)
- kotlin
- groovy
- scala

Adding support for other languages is [straightforward](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/blob/main/selfie-lib/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/diffplug/selfie/guts/Literals.kt), PRs are welcome!

### Maven

If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.diffplug.selfie</groupId>
    <artifactId>selfie-runner-junit5</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Replace `LATEST_VERSION` with the latest available version of selfie.

### Gradle

For Gradle users, add this to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
testImplementation 'com.diffplug.selfie:selfie-runner-junit5:LATEST_VERSION'
```

Again, replace `LATEST_VERSION` with the latest available version of selfie.

## Quickstart

Let's say we have the following test code:

```java
expectSelfie(List.of(1, 2, 3).toString()).toBe_TODO();
```

If you run this test, selfie will rewrite your sourcecode to be this:

```java
expectSelfie(List.of(1, 2, 3).toString()).toBe("[1, 2, 3]");
```

Now, let's change the code to this:

```java
expectSelfie(List.of(42).toString()).toBe("[1, 2, 3]");
```

When we run the test, we will get a failure, and the failure message will be:

```
Snapshot mismatch
- update this snapshot by adding `_TODO` to the function name
- update all snapshots in this file by adding `//selfieonce` or `//SELFIEWRITE`
```

As you can see, we have three options:

- replace `toBe` with `toBe_TODO` (you can leave or remove the `"[1, 2, 3]"`, makes no difference)
  - rewrites only this one snapshot, and selfie will remove the `_TODO`
- put `//selfieonce` anywhere in the file
  - rewrites all snapshots in the file, and selfie will remove `//selfieonce` after it has done so
- put `//SELFIEWRITE` anywhere in that file
  - rewrites all snapshots in the file until you remove `//SELFIEWRITE` yourself

## Disk

To store a snapshot on disk, swap `toBe` for `toMatchDisk`:

```java
expectSelfie(List.of(1, 2, 3).toString()).toMatchDisk_TODO();
```

This will create a file called `SomethingOrOther.ss` in the same directory as your test. It will also rewrite the test source to:

```java
expectSelfie(List.of(1, 2, 3).toString()).toMatchDisk();
```

Just like inline literal snapshots, you can use  `_TODO`, `//selfieonce`, and `//SELFIEWRITE` to control how the snapshots are written and updated. You don't have to use `_TODO` if you have the `//selfieonce` or `//SELFIEWRITE` comments in your file.

If you want the disk snapshots to live in a different folder, set `snapshotFolderName` using [SelfieSettings](https://kdoc.selfie.dev/selfie-runner-junit5/com.diffplug.selfie.junit5/-selfie-settings-a-p-i/).

## CI

The nice thing about `//SELFIEWRITE` is that all of your snapshots will update on every run, which makes it easy to explore ‚Äî like multiassert on steroids. **The bad thing about `//SELFIEWRITE` is that all of the tests always pass, even if the snapshots actually change on every run.**

For example, you might have a realtime timestamp or a random port number embedded in a snapshot. Randomness and realtime cannot be present in a repeatable assertion, and you might not realize that a tiny part of a large snapshot is changing while you're in `//SELFIEWRITE` mode.

For this reason, it is critical that a CI server should always run in `readonly` mode. No action is needed on your part, selfie automatically puts itself into `readonly` mode if the `CI=true` environment variable is present, which is true for all popular CI systems.

When in `readonly` mode, selfie not only refuses to update any snapshots, it also fails the build if `_TODO`, `//selfieonce`, or `//SELFIEWRITE` are present in the sourcecode, even if the snapshots were correct. Writing snapshots is a strictly private affair üòè.

## Beyond toString

All of the examples so far have asserted on Strings. You can also do inline literal assertions on primitive values, and disk assertions on byte arrays:

```java 
expectSelfie(10/4).toBe(2);
expectSelfie((10/4) == 2).toBe(true);
expectSelfie(TimeUnit.DAYS.toMillis(365*1_000_000L)).toBe(31_536_000_000_000_000L);
expectSelfie(new byte[100]).toMatchDisk();
```

But the real power of selfie is asserting on arbitrary objects using **facets**, which are covered in the [advanced section](/jvm/advanced).

## Reference

Full API documentation is available at [kdoc.selfie.dev](https://kdoc.selfie.dev/).

- `.toBe_TODO()` or `.toBe_TODO(argumentIsIgnored)`
  - creates or updates an inline literal snapshot
- `.toMatchDisk_TODO()`
  - creates or updates a disk snapshot
- `//selfieonce`
  - all snapshots in the file will be updated, whether they are `_TODO` or not
  - selfie will remove the comment after the snapshots have updated
- `//SELFIEWRITE`
  - all snapshots in the file will be updated, whether they are `_TODO` or not
  - selfie will not remove the comment after the snapshots have updated
- mode is set by the `SELFIE` environment variable or system property
  - `interactive`, default
  - `readonly`, default if `CI` environment variable is `true`
  - `overwrite`, all snapshots can be overwritten
- `Camera` and `Lens` are covered in the [advanced section](/jvm/advanced).
