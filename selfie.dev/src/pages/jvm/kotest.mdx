## Using Selfie with Kotest tldr

- follow the regular JVM [get started](./get-started) instructions
- add `SelfieExtension(projectConfig)` to your `AbstractProjectConfig`
- make the following swap:
  ```diff
  -import com.diffplug.selfie.Selfie.expectSelfie
  +import com.diffplug.selfie.coroutines.expectSelfie
  ```
And you're good to go!

### Detailed setup

Selfie has two artifacts which can run Kotest tests.

- `com.diffplug.selfie:selfie-runner-junit5`
  - Works with regular JUnit tests and also Kotest tests.
  - JVM only
- `com.difplug.selfie:selfie-runner-kotest`
  - Cannot run JUnit tests, only Kotest.
  - Written in Kotlin Multiplatform (only JVM implemented so far, [PRs for other platforms welcome](https://github.com/diffplug/selfie/issues/186))

You must choose only one, you'll get an error if both are on the classpath. You'll need to add the `SelfieExtension` to your `AbstractProjectConfig` like so:

```kotlin
import com.diffplug.selfie.junit5.SelfieExtension // selfie-runner-junit5
import com.diffplug.selfie.kotest.SelfieExtension // selfie-runner-kotest
import io.kotest.core.config.AbstractProjectConfig

class ProjectConfig : AbstractProjectConfig() {
  override fun extensions() = listOf(SelfieExtension(this))
}
```

## Selfie and coroutines

In a regular JUnit 5 test, you call `Selfie.expectSelfie(...)`, like so

```kotlin
import com.diffplug.selfie.Selfie.expectSelfie
class TestClass {
  @Test fun testMethod() {
    expectSelfie(something).toMatchDisk()
  }
}
```

Every Kotest test is a `suspend fun`, not a regular `fun`. You **must** use the functions in the `coroutines` package instead of `Selfie`.

```kotlin
import com.diffplug.selfie.coroutines.expectSelfie
class TestSpec : FunSpec({
  test("testMethod") {
    expectSelfie(something).toMatchDisk()
  }
})
```

If you use `Selfie` instead of `coroutines` you'll get a runtime error reminding you to use the `coroutines` function instead.

### Threading implementation details

Inline literal `toBe` snapshots don't need to know what test is currently running. But a `toMatchDisk` snapshot needs to know which test is running so that it can put the correct name into the snapshot file.

For a JUnit test, `selfie-runner-junit5` uses a `ThreadLocal` to pass information about the currently running test. For a Kotest test using either runner, `selfie-runner-junit5` or `selfie-runner-kotest`, the information is stored in the coroutine context, which can only be accessed from a `suspend fun`. This is why you must use `coroutines.expectSelfie` instead of `Selfie.expectSelfie`.

This issue only matters for disk snapshots. This creates a chance for confusion where you might be using inline literal `toBe` snapshots without any problem. Then you try `toMatchDisk` snapshots and get an error telling you to switch from `Selfie.expectSelfie` to `coroutines.expectSelfie`. This is expected, just make the switch and you'll be good to go.
