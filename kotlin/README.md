It's a standard Gradle build, `./gradlew build` to assemble and test everything.

One tricky thing is that inline snapshots requires changing the code being tested. To make this work, we  have `undertest` projects. Their `test` task is disabled, and they have an `underTest` task instead. You'll note that every test in these projects is named `UT_SomethingTest`. That's because there is a corresponding `SomethingTest` in `selfie-runner-junit5` , and `SomethingTest` works by changing the source code in `UT_SomethingTest`, running builds, and making assertions about the state of snapshots and source code after the build.
